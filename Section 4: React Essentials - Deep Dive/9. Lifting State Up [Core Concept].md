# Lifting State Up

Lift the state up to the `closest ancestor component` that has access to all components that need to work with that state

## Ancestor Component

-   Manages `State` value that's needed by both `Child 1` & `Child 2`
-   Ancestor passes a function that eventually changes the state via props to the child component
-   This allows the child component to initiate the state change
-   Ancestor passes the state value via props to the child component

| Child Component 1 | Child Component 2 |
