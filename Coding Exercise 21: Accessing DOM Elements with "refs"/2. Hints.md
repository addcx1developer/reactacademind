# Hints

-   The `click()` method can be called on the native, built-in JS object that's provided by the browser, when you <i>"get hold"</i> of the `<input type="file">` element in your JS code
-   To <i>"get hold"</i> of that element, you should use React's "ref" feature
-   Only call `click()` when the `<button>` was clicked
-   Listen to `<button>` clicks by adding an event handler function as you learned it earlier in the course
