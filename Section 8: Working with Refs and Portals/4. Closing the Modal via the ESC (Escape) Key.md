# Closing the Modal via the ESC (Escape) Key

The `<dialog>` element allows website visitors to close the opened dialog by pressing the <kbd>`ESC`</kbd> (Escape) key on their keyboard.

Currently, this will <b>not</b> trigger the `onReset` function though (unlike closing the dialog with a button click).

To make sure that `onReset` gets triggered when the dialog is closed via the escape key, you should add the built-in `onClose` prop to the `<dialog>` element and bind it to the `onReset` prop value.

Like this:

```
<dialog ref={dialog} className="result-modal" onClose={onReset}
    ...
</dialog>
```
