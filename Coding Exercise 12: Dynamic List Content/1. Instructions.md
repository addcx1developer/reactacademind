# Dynamic List Content

You're working on a "Todo List" web app and your task is to <b>output a list of dummy todo items dynamically</b>. For this task, a `Todo` component has been prepared for you, though you must still add some code to it to <b>receive and output</b> the todo text.

To be more precise: In the `App` component, you should transform the `DUMMY_TODOS` array that's provided to you (which must not be changed!) to a list of JSX elements (`<Todo>` elements to be precise). Every `Todo` component item must receive and output the todo text via a prop called `text`.

The final UI should look like this:
