# Hints

-   Don't forget to export the `Card` component (as a `default`)
-   Remember that the `Card` component should be wrappable around JSX code AND, in addition, must accept & output a name prop
-   Not sure how to wrap a component around JSX code? Remember that there is a special, built-in prop that's passed to every component by React...
