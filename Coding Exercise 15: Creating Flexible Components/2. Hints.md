# Hints

-   You don't need to work on any other file than `Button.js`!
-   How about supporting different <i>"modes"</i> via some prop that's accepted by the `Button`?
-   Add the styling for the different modes with help of CSS classes
-   All buttons need a `button` CSS class!
-   Keep in mind that you can build a list of CSS classes that should be assigned to an element dynamically (e..g, via template literals or string concatenation)
-   Also keep in mind that you can concatenate strings conditionally (e.g., by adding string values to an existing string from inside an `if` statement)
-   Don't forget that you can combine explicitly extracted props (`{ someProp }`), built-in props like `children` and "rest property" props (`...props`) in the same component
-   To support both buttons with and without icons, you'll probably need to output some content (in the `Button` component) conditionally
-   Why might the `Icon` prop (in the `App.js` file, where the custom `<Button>` is used) be named `Icon` and not icon? Maybe it's important?
