# Hints

-   Two-way-binding consists of <b>two key elements</b>:
    -   You must <b>listen to changes</b> to the input (and store the new value somewhere)
    -   You must output the stored <b>value</b> in the input
-   When updated, the stored input values should cause the `App` component to be re-evaluated by React
-   The stored values should also be passed (as props) to the `Review` component so that they are displayed by that component (take a look at the `Review` component code in `Review.js` to see which props are expected)
-   In this Udemy workspace, you must use `React.useState()` (i.e., just `import React from 'react'`) and NOT just `useState()` (i.e., `import { useState } from 'react'` also won't work)
