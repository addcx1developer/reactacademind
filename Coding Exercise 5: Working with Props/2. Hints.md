# Hints

-   Use the props concept to make a component configurable & reusable
-   Keep in mind that every component receives a props object - automatically, provided by React
-   Set prop values by adding them as key-value pairs (like "custom attributes") on your components when using them in JSX code
-   The received props object contains all the "attributes" you set on the component (when using it in JSX code) as properties
