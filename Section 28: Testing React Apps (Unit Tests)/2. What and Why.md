# What is "`Testing`"?

| Manual Testing                                                                     | Automated Testing                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write Code -> Preview & Test in Browser -> Improve Code -> Repeat                  | Write code that automatically tests your code                                                           |
| Very important: You see what your users will see                                   | You test the individual building blocks of your app                                                     |
| <b>Error-prone:</b> it's hard to always test all possible combinations & scenarios | Requires extra knowledge (-> how to write tests) but allows you to test all building blocks of your app |

# Different Kinds Of Automated Tests

| Unit Tests                                                                   | Integration Tests                                        | End-to-End (E2E) Tests                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test the `individual building blocks` (functions, components) in `isolation` | Test the `combination` of multiple building blocks       | Test `complete scenarios / user flows` in your app (as the user would experience them) |
| Projects typically contain dozens or hundreds of unit tests                  | Projects typically contain a couple of integration tests | Projects typically contain only a few E2E tests                                        |
| The most common / important kind of test                                     | Also important, but focus on unit tests in most cases    | Important but can also be done manually (partially)                                    |

# What Should You Test?

| What?                                                            | How?                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test the different app building blocks                           | Test success and error cases, also test rare (but possible) results |
| `Unit tests:` The smallest building blocks that make up your app |                                                                     |
