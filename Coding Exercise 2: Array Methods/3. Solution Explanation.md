# Solution Explanation

Inside the `transformToObjects()` function, you should use the `map()` method to transform all values of the received `numberArray` parameter (which will be an array of numbers).

The following code transforms the received number array as requested:

```
function transformToObjects(numberArray) {
    return numberArray.map(number => {
        return { val: number }
    });
}
```

This code uses an arrow function. Of course, you could also use a <i>"normal function"</i> (with the `function` keyword).
