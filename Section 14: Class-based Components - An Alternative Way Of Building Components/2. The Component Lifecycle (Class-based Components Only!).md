# Class Components Lifecycle

<b>Side Effects</b> in <b>Functional</b> Components: `useEffect()`

## Class-based components can't use Hooks!

`componentDidMount()`

-   Called once a component `mounted`
-   Evaluated & rendered by React
-   useEffect(..., [])

`componentDidUpdate()`

-   Called once a component `updated`
-   Re-evaluated & re-rendered by React
-   useEffect(..., [someValue])

`componentWillUnmount()`

-   Called right before component is `unmounted`
-   Right before removed from DOM
-   useEffect(() => { return () => { ... } }, [])
