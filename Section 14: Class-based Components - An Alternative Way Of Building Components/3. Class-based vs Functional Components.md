# Class-based vs Functional Components

You Don't Have To Use Functional Components!

You can use class-based components if you prefer them (though it's really not necessarily recommended...)

## Which Component Type Should You Use?

<b>Strong Recommendation</b>: You should prefer `functional components!`

Use class-based...

-   ...you <b>prefer</b> them
-   ...you're working on an existing project or in a team where they're getting used
-   ...you're building an Error Boundary
