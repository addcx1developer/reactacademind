# What's So Difficult?

| Form Submission                                 | Input Validation                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handling submission is relatively `easy`        | Providing a good user experience is `tricky`                               |
| Entered values can be managed via `state`       | You can `validate` on every `keystroke` -> errors may be shown `too early` |
| Alternatively, they can be extracted via `refs` | You can `validate` on `lost focus` -> errors may be shown `too long`       |
| Or via `FormData` and native browser features   | You can `validate` on `form submission` -> errors may be shown `too late`  |
