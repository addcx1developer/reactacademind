# Hints

-   You will need to work with some <i>"should the warning be shown?"</i> state (via `React.useState()`) for this exercise
-   You could manage an `isDeleting` state value that's either `true` (in which case the warning box is shown) or `false` (in which case it's not shown)
-   This state must be updated (and set to the appropriate value) whenever the two `<button>`s are clicked
-   Based on the `isDeleting` state (or however you named it) you should include or exclude the `<div id="alert">...</div>` JSX code (e.g., via a variable or ternary expression)
