# React Code Must Be Transformed!

## React Code

-   JavaScript code that typically uses JSX ("HTML in JavaScript")

## Handled by build tool (e.g., Vite)

-   Code is <b>transformed</b> & <b>optimized</b> (e.g., unnecessary whitespace is removed)
-   That's why a "more complex" project setup (which includes such a build tool) is needed

## Code that runs in the browser

-   JavaScript code without JSX
