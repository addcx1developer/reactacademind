# Hints

-   Make sure `counterReducer` gets exported and also don't change its name (otherwise, the automatic checks fail)!
-   Don't forget that the `counterReducer` function will need some input (parameters) to work correctly
-   Dispatch action objects that have a `type` property (where `type` is `'INCREMENT'`, `'DECREMENT'` or `'RESET'`)
-   Don't forget that `useReducer()`, like `useState()`, always returns an array with exactly two elements
-   One element is for reading the current state, the other element is for changing it - though it'll work differently than it does when using `useState()`
