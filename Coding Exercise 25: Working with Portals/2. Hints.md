# Hints

-   Show / hide the `Toast` component conditionally with help of state that's set from inside `handleEnrol` and the `setTimeout` callback
-   You can "move" the rendered JSX code of a component to a different place in the DOM with help of a special function exposed by React's "DOM" library (`react-dom`)
-   That special function needs the to-be-moved JSX code as a first argument and the DOM element into which it should be injected as a second argument
