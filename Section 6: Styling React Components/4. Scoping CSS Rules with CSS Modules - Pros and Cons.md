Vanilla CSS with file-specific scoping

| Advantages                                                                                              | Disadvantages                                                       |

| CSS code is decoupled                                                                                   | You need to know CSS                                                |
| You write CSS code as you (maybe) know and (maybe) love it                                              | You may end up with many relatively small CSS files in your project |
| CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code |
| CSS classes are scoped to the component (files) which import them -> No CSS class name clashes          |
