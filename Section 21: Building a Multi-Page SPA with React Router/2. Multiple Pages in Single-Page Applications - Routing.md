# What is a Routing?

```
/welcome (welcome.html) -> URL Changes & Visible content changes -> /products (products.html)

Page Change = New Request + Response (HTML is requested & loaded)
```

# Building SPAs

When building complex user interfaces, we typically build `Single Page Applications` (SPAs)

-   Only one initial HTML request & response
-   Page (URL) changes are then handled by client-side React code
-   Visible content is changed without fetching a new HTML file
