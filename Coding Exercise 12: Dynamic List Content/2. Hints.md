# Hints

-   Arrays can (and should) be transformed into JSX elements via the built-in `map()` method
-   Keep in mind that `someArray.map(...)` must be wrapped with curly braces if used in JSX code
-   `map()` takes a function that automatically receives the individual array item as an argument and returns the new value (to which the item should be transformed)
-   To pass the todo text (which is different for every todo item) to the `Todo` component, you should use a `text` prop (`props.text` inside the `Todo` component, `<Todo text="...">` inside the `App` component)
