# Hints

-   Keep in mind that you can use special, built-in props on those built-in elements to "connect" functions to event listeners
-   Maybe the names of those special props start with `on`?
-   Keep in mind that you can use function as values
-   It shouldn't be you who executes the event handling function
-   Update the user data via `user.email = "new value"` etc.
