# How Does Authentication Work?

Authentication is needed if content should be `protected` (i.e., if content should not be accessible by everyone)

## Getting Permission

```
Client (Browser) <-> Request (with user credentials) / Response (access granted: yes / no) <-> Server (Backend)
```

Is that enough?

A "yes" alone is `not enough` to access protected resources /API endpoints

```
Client (Browser) <-> Request (with user credentials) / Response (-> Auth Token <-) <-> Server (Backend)
```

## Client and server can't just exchange a "Yes"

Any client could simply send a request to our backend that "tells" the backend that we previously were granted access

| Server-side Sessions                                                                       | Authentication Tokens                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Store unique identifier on server, send same identifier to client                          | Create (but not store) "permission" token on server & send it to the client |
| Client sends identifier along with requests to protected resources                         | Client attaches token to future requests for protected resources            |
| Server can then check if the identifier is valid (= previously issued by server to client) | Server can then verify the attached token                                   |

## Working with Decoupled Backends

Client (Browser) <- No persistent connection (Since the backend "doesn't care about client", it also doesn't store any client-related data [-> sessions]) -> Server (Backend)
|Client (Browser)|Server (Backend)|
|-|-|
|Most React apps are `SPAs` that are served by a server that's `decoupled from the backend`|A `decoupled backend` is served by `different server` than the React frontend app|
|The SPA `handles routing` (on the client side) and only "talks" to the backend if it `needs data` (or needs to change data)|The backend `provides various resources routes` with which the client-side app my communicate|
||The backend does not register client-side routing actions or user interactions -> it `may theoretically server multiple, different client-side apps` (React apps, mobile apps, etc)|
