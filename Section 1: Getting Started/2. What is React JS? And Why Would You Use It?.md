# What is React.JS? And Why Exactly Would You Use It?

-   The library for web and native user interfaces
-   React is a <b>library</b> for building <b>user interfaces</b>
-   A <b><i>JavaScript</i> library</b> for building <b>user interfaces</b>

## Why React?

-   React is extremely popular
-   It makes building complex, interactive UIs a breeze
-   It's powerful & flexible
-   It has a very active and versatile ecosystem

## Using "Just JavaScript" <i>Typically Isn't A Great Option</i>

-   Writing complex JavaScript code quickly becomes <b>cumbersome</b>
-   Complex JavaScript code quickly becomes <b>error-prone</b>
-   Complex JavaScript code often is <b>hard to maintain or edit</b>
-   React offers a <b>simpler mental model</b>

## Core Features

-   Components, JSX & Props
-   State
-   Hooks (e.g., useEffect())
-   Dynamic rendering

## React vs Vanilla JavaScript

-   Vanilla JavaScript requires imperative programming
    -   Imperative Programming: You define all the steps needed to achieve a result
-   React on the other hand embraces declarative programming
-   With React, you define the goal and React figures out how to get there

## React = Declarative UI Programming

-   With React, you <b>define the target UI state(s)</b> - not the steps to get there! Instead, React will figure out & perform the necessary steps

### React - Declarative

-   Define the goal, not the steps

```
let content;

if (user.isLoggedIn) {
    content = <button>Continue</button>
} else {
    content = <button>Log In</button>
}

return content;
```

### Vanilla JavaScript - Imperative

-   Define the steps, not the goal

```
let btn = document.querySelector('button');

if (user.isLoggedIn) {
    button.textContent = 'Continue';
} else {
    button.textContent = 'Log In';
}

document.body.append(btn);
```
