# Solution Explanation

In this provided solution (see below), a new component function named `MainGoal` is created.

This function returns a `<p>` element that contains the text <i>"My main goal: Learn React from the ground up."</i>.

That's an important <b>first step</b>, because this code <b>defines</b> this custom component.

It does, however, <b>not</b> use this component yet.

<b>To use it</b>, you have to include it like a <b>custom HTML element</b> in the JSX code of some other component - in this case of the `App` component.

There, at very end of the returned JSX code, you'll find the `<MainGoal />` component being used like a custom element.

```
export function MainGoal() {
    return <p>My main goal: Learn React from the ground up.</p>;
}
```

```
function App() {
    return (
        <div id="app">
            <h1>Time to Practice!</h1>
            <p>
                Build a <code>&lt;MainGoal&gt;</code> component and insert it below this text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your <code>&lt;MainGoal&gt;</code> component should simply output some text that describes your main course goal (e.g., &quot;My main goal: Learn React in great detail&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> You custom component must contain the text &quot;My main goal:&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Also important:</strong> For the automatic checks to succeed, you <strong>must export</strong> your custom component function! Not as a default but simply by adding the <code>export</code> keyword in front of your function (e.g., <code>export function YOUR_COMPONENT_NAME</code>).
            </p>
            {/* DON'T CHANGE THE TEXT / CONTENT ABOVE */}
            {/* OUTPUT YOUR COMPONENT HERE */}
            <MainGoal />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
