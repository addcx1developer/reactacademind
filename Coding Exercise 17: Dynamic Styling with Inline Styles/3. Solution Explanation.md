# Solution Explanation

In the solution (scroll down for the full code), a `choice` state is added to the `App` component - this state is needed in order to set different color values depending on which button was pressed.

The choice state is either `null` (the initial value), `"yes"` (if the <i>"Yes"</i> button was pressed) or `"no"` (for the <i>"No"</i> button).

Of course, that's just one way of solving this - you could come up with a different state that stores slightly different state values. In the end, you just need some state that allows you to dynamically assign inline styles to the `<h1>` element.

This state is then changed with help of event listener functions that are "connected" to the `onClick` props of the <i>"Yes"</i> and <i>"No"</i> buttons.

In the solution, anonymous functions are used but you could also create and bind separate named functions instead.

Last but not least, the `style` prop is set on the `<h1>` element. It receives an object as a value (as expected by React).

In that object, the `color` property is either set to `"white"` (if no button was clicked), `"green"` (if `choice === "yes"`, i.e. , the <i>"Yes"</i> button was clicked) or `"red"` (if `choice === "no"`, i.e., the <i>"No"</i> button was clicked).

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState(null);

    let textColor = 'white';

    if (choice === 'yes') {
        textColor = 'green';
    } else if (choice === 'no') {
        textColor = 'red';
    }

    return (
        <div id="app">
            <h1 style={{ color: textColor }}>CSS is great!</h1>
            <menu>
                <li>
                    <button onClick={() => setChoice('yes')}>Yes</button>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <button onClick={() => setChoice('no')}>No</button>
                </li>
            </menu>
        </div>
    );
}
```
