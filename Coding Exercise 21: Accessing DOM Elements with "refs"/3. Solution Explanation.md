# Solution Explanation

In the solution, a new "ref" is created by calling React's `useRef` Hook. This ref is then <i>"connected"</i> to the `<input type="file">` element by setting the special `ref` prop on that JSX element:

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    const filePicker = React.useRef();

    return (
        <div id="app">
            <p>Please select an image</p>
            <p>
                <input
                    data-testid="file-picker"
                    type="file"
                    accept="image/*"
                    ref={filePicker}
                 />
                <button>Pick Image</button>
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This alone doesn't do much though - the file picker is not getting "triggered".

To change this, a `handleStartPickImage` event listener function is added to the `App` component and set as a value for the `onClick` prop of the `<button>` element.

Inside that function, the `filePicker` ref is then used to get access to the file picker element's underlying JS object. This is achieved by accessing the `current` property on the `filePicker` ref. This is necessary because refs <b>always</b> are objects with a `current` property (which then holds the actual value assigned to the ref).

By calling the built-in `click()` method on the underlying input object the file picker is then <i>"triggered"</i> without being visible:

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    const filePicker = React.useRef();

    function handleStartPickImage() {
        filePicker.current.click();
    }

    return (
        <div id="app">
            <p>Please select an image</p>
            <p>
                <input data-testid="file-picker" type="file" accept="image/*" ref={filePicker} />
                <button onClick={handleStartPickImage}>Pick Image</button>
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}
```
