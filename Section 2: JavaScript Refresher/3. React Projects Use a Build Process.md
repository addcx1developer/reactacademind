# React projects use a build process

-   The code <b>you write</b> is <b>not</b> the code that gets <b>executed</b> (like this) in the browser
-   Your code is <b>transformed</b> before it's handed off to the browser

1. Raw, unprocessed React code <b>won't execute</b> in the browser
    - JSX is not a default JavaScript feature
2. In addition, the code would <b>not be optimized for production</b> (e.g., not minified)

-   React projects require a <b>build process</b> that transforms your code
    -   create-react-app, vite etc. give you such a build process (no custom setup or tweaking needed)
