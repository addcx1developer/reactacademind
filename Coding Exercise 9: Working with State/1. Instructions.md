# Working with State

You're working on a part of an online shop where a discounted price should be displayed on the screen once the user clicked a button.

Your task is to add an <b>event listener</b> to listen for <b>clicks</b> on the button that's already included in the `App` component.

Upon a button click, the <b>price should change</b> from `$100` to `$75`.

<b>Add a state value</b> to the existing `App` component function and make sure the state value is both <b>updated</b> upon button clicks and <b>output</b> as part of the JSX code.

<b>Important:</b> In this Udemy environment, you <b>CAN'T</b> import & use `useState` like this:

```
import { useState } from 'react';
...
useState();
```

Instead, import & use it like this (in your component):

```
import React from 'react';
...
React.useState();
```
