# Server vs Client Components

| React Server Components (RSC)                              | Client Components                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Components that are `only` rendered on the server          | Components that are `pre-rendered` on the server but then also `potentially on the client` |
| By default, all React components (in NextJS apps) are RSCs | Opt-in via "use client" directive                                                          |
| Advantage: Less client-side JS, great for SEO              | Advantage: Client-side interactivity                                                       |
