# How To Connect A Backend / Database

## Frontend

With React, you build a `client-side` web application (= it runs in the browser)

## HTTP Request

You communicate with a backend (API) via `HTTP requests`

## Backend - (REST) API

A web server that exposes certain "endpoints" (URLs) to which you can send requests & data (to receive data back)

## API

Stands for "`application programming interface`".

## Rest API

Is a web server that exposes certain pre-defined routes to which HTTP requests can be sent.

##

You should `not` try to `connect to a database` directly (-> credentials would be exposed)

Frontend (React app) & backend (API) are `often separated` (= separate projects)

| Frontend           | Backend    |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| React (JavaScript) | PHP        |
|                    | C#         |
|                    | Java       |
|                    | JavaScript |
|                    | ...        |
