# Solution Explanation

In my solution, I <b>wrapped</b> the `handleCreateUser` execution with an anonymous function.

```
<button onClick={() => handleCreateUser('Heather')}>Create User</button>
```

It's therefore now this wrapping function that will be executed when the `click` event occurs. The code in the function body will therefore also only execute when that happens.

Hence, you can safely call `handleCreateUser('Heather')` inside of that <i>"wrapping function"</i> without executing it too early.
