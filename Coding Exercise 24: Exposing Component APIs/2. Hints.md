# Hints

-   For this task, you should <b>not</b> forward a `ref` from the `App` component directly to the `<form>` element inside the `Form` component!
-   But you will need to forward a ref - it just shouldn't be connected to the `<form>` element
-   Instead, use that `ref` to expose a `clear()` method
-   Keep in mind that you can expose methods from a component function with help of a special React Hook
-   That Hook will need to work with a `ref` that's forwarded to the `Form` component
-   You will also need to create another `ref` (inside the `Form` component) to interact with the `<form>` element and trigger its `reset()` method (when the exposed `clear()` method is triggered)
-   You can reset a form by calling the built-in `reset()` method on the underlying form object (which can be retrieved by connecting a `ref` to the `<form>` element)
