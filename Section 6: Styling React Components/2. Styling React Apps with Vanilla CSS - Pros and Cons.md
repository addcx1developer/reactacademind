| CSS Code is decoupled from JSX code                                                                     | You need to know CSS                                                                                                                                         |
| You write CSS code as you (maybe) know and (maybe) love it                                              | CSS code is not scoped to components -> CSS rule may clash across components (e.g., same CSS class name used in different components for different purposes) |
| CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code |
