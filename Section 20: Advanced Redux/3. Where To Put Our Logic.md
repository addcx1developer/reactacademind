# Fat Reducers vs Fat Components vs Fat Actions

Where should your `logic` (= code) go?

```
Synchronous, side-effect free code (i.e., data transformations)
```

-   <b>Prefer</b> reducers
-   <b>Avoid</b> action creators or components

```
Async code or code with side-effects
```

-   <b>Prefer</b> action creators or components
-   <b>Never use reducers!</b>
