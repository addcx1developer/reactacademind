# Time To Practice: Food Order App

Components, State, Context, Effects, HTTP Requests & More!

-   Building a `Complete Project` From The Ground Up
-   `Building & Configuring Components`
-   Using `State & Context`
-   Managing `HTTP Requests & Side Effects`

## A Challenge For You

Build a "Food Order" web app

-   Use the `starting project` attached to this lecture
-   Add `components` for displaying `products`, the cart (in a `modal`) and a `checkout form` (also in a `modal`)
-   `Fetch` the (dummy) meals data from the `backend` & show it on the screen (GET /meals)
-   Allow users to `add & remove` products to / from the `cart`
-   `Send cart data` along with `user data` (full name, email, street, postal code, city) to the `backend` (POST /orders)
-   Handle `loading & error` states
