# Solution Explanation

The provided starting code has <b>two errors</b> in it:

1. `<Div>` should be `<div>`
2. `onclick` should be `onClick`

<b>`<Div>` should be `<div>`</b>

In React apps, your own, <b>custom components</b> must start with an <b>uppercase</b> character. But those built-in, <b>default HTML element</b> components (like `<p>`, `<input>`, `<div>` etc.) all start with a <b>lowercase</b> character.

That applies to both the opening and closing tag: It should be `<div>...</div>` instead of `<Div>...</Div>`.

<b>`onclick` should be `onClick`</b>

Event listeners are added to components via the `onXYZ` props (where `XYZ` defines the event name) - for <i>"click"</i> events, `onClick` should be used therefore.

<b>The casing matters here! </b>

`onclick` is not the same as `onClick` - and indeed `onclick` is wrong and won't work.

Hence, to fix this error, `<button onclick={...}>` must be changed to `<button onClick={...}>`.
