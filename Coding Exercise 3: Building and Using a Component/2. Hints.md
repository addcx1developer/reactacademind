# Hints

-   Keep in mind that components are defined as JavaScript functions
-   Component functions must return renderable content - typically JSX code
-   Don't forget to `export` the `MainGoal` component function (`export function MainGoal() { ... }`) - otherwise the automatic tests won't detect your solution correctly
-   Don't forget to include the text <i>"My main goal"</i> in the text output by your `MainGoal` component - otherwise the automatic tests won't detect your solution correctly
