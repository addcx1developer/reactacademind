# Hints

-   Register a click listener by adding a special prop to the `<button>` element (`on...`)
-   Pass a pointer at the to-be-executed function to the event listener prop added to the `<button>`
-   Use the `useState()` Hook to register a state value
-   Keep in mind that the `useState()` Hook returns an array with multiple elements
-   Output the state value via curly braces in your JSX code
-   Update the state by using the state updating function provided by `useState()`
