# JavaScript Can Be Executed In Many Environments

## In the Browser (i.e., as part of websites)

-   JavaScript code can be included in any website
-   The code then executes inside the browser (i.e., on the machine of the website visitor)

## On any Computer (e.g., server-side code)

-   Thanks to Node.JS or Deno, JavaScript code can be executed outside of the browser too
-   The code then executes directly on the machine

## On mobile Devices (e.g., via embedded websites)

-   With extra technologies like Capacitor or React Native, you can build mobile apps based on JavaScript
-   The code then executes on the mobile device

# Adding JavaScript Code To A Website

## Between `<script>` Tags

```
<script>
    alert('Hello')
</script>
```

-   Can quickly lead to unmaintainable & complex HTML files
-   Typically only used for very short scripts

## Via `<script>` Import

```
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

-   Separates HTML & JavaScript code
-   Maintaining complex JS powered apps becomes easier
