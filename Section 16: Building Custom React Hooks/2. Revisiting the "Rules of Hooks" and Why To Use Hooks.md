# Rules of Hooks - Updated

1. Only call Hooks `in Component or Other Hook Functions`
   React Hooks must not be called outside of React component functions or other Hook functions

    ```
    function App() {
        const [val, setVal] = useState(0); ✅
    }
    ```

    ```
    const [val, setVal] = useState(0); ❎

    function App() { ... }
    ```

2. Only call Hooks `on the top level`
   React Hooks must not be called in nested code statements (e.g., inside of if-statements)

    ```
    function App() {
        const [val, setVal] = useState(0); ✅
    }
    ```

    ```
    function App() {
        if (someCondition)
            const [val, setVal] = useState(0); ❎
    }
    ```
