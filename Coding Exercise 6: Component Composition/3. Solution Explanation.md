# Solution Explanation

In this solution, a new `Card` component function is created and exported.

```
export default function Card({ name, children }) {
    return (
        <article className="card">
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            {children}
        </article>
    );
}
```

The `Card` component function destructures the (automatically) received props object to "pull out" to prop values:

-   `name`
-   `children`

The `children` prop is a special prop that's automatically provided to every component function. It contains the wrapped content as a value.

So the children prop's value for this code:

```
<Card>
    <p>Hi there</p>
</Card>
```

would be `<p>Hi there</p>`.

The `Card` component then outputs the received `name` between `<h2>` tags (though you can output via any HTML tags of your choice - you don't have to use `<h2>`!).

The `children` prop is then output directly below that title. Therefore, any content passed between the `<Card>` opening and closing tags is output below the `<h2>` element.
