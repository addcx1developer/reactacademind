# Side Effects, Async Tasks & Redux

Reducers must be `pure, side-effect free, synchronous` functions!

```
Old State + Action (Input) -> New State (Output)
```

## Where should side-effects & async tasks be executed?

```
Inside the components (e.g., via useEffect())
```

```
Inside the action creators
```
