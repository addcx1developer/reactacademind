# What Is Cross-Component & App-Wide State?

## Local State - [][]`[]`[][]

-   State belongs to a single component
-   E.g., listening to user input on an input field or toggling a "show more details" field
-   Should be `managed inside the component` via `useState()` / `useReducer()`

## Cross-component State - []`[][][]`[]

-   State affecting multiple components
-   E.g., open / closed state of a modal overlay
-   Requires "`prop drilling`"
-   Or: <b>React Context</b> or <b>Redux</b>

## App-wide State - `[][][][][]`

-   State affecting the entire app
-   E.g., user authentication status or chosen theme
-   Requires "`prop drilling`"
-   Or: <b>React Context</b> or <b>Redux</b>

# React Context Manages Multi-Component State

## Cart Context

-   Cart State
-   App
    -   Shop
        -   Product (Update Cart [Cart State])
    -   Header
        -   CartModal
            -   Cart (Display Cart [Cart State])
