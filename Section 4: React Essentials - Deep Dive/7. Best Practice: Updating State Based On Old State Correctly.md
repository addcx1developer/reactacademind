# Updating State Based On Old State

```
setIsEditing(!isEditing);
```

-   If your <b>new state depends on your previous state</b> value, you should `not` update the state like this

```
setIsEditing(wasEditing => !wasEditing);
```

-   Instead. `pass a function` to your state updating function
-   This function will <b>automatically be called</b> by React and will receive the <b>guaranteed latest state value</b>

| setIsEditing(false)                                                           | 2. Update state to false                                             |
| setIsEditing(true)                                                            | 3. Update state to true                                              |
| setIsEditing(false)                                                           | 4. Update state to false                                             |

-   State updates are <b>not performed instantly</b> but at same point in the future (when React has time for it)
-   In most cases, those state updates of course still are executed <b>almost instantly</b>
