# Solution Explanation

In JavaScript, functions can be created via the `function` keyword. Hence a `combine` function can be created like this:

```
function combine() {

}
```

This function <b>won't do anything yet</b> though.

To solve this exercise, the function should accept three input values - i.e., three parameters:

```
function combine(a, b, c) {

}
```

The <b>parameter names</b> are <b>totally up to you</b> - instead of `a`, `b` and `c`, you could've also used `val1`, `val2` and `val3` or anything else!

To derive the requested calculation result, you can then add a new variable or constant inside of the function (and use the `*` and `/` operators for the actual calculation):

```
function combine(a, b, c) {
    const result = a * b / c; // or use "let" => up to you
}
```

Last but not least, the result must be returned - this can be achieved by the built-in `return` keyword:

```
function combine(a, b, c) {
    const result = a * b / c; // or use "let" => up to you
    return result;
}
```
