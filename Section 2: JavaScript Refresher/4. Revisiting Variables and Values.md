#### Objects

# Variables Are Data Containers

#### Variable (userMessage)

-   A variable stores a value

"Hi everyone!" << Value (Type: String)
```

# Why Use Variables?

1. Reusability
    - Store a value in a variable once and use it as often and in as many places as needed
2. Readability
    - Organize your code over several lines rather than cramming everything into single line

# Identifiers Must Follow Certain Rules & Recommendations

1. Must not contain whitespaces or special characters (except $ and \_)
    - <b>Valid:</b> $userName, age, user_name, data$, ...
    - <b>Invalid:</b> %userName, age/, user name, ...
2. May contain numbers but must not start with a number
    - <b>Valid:</b> user3, us3r, ...

3. Must not clash with reserved keywords
    - <b>Valid:</b> user, age, data, ...
    - <b>Invalid:</b> let, const, if, ...

    - <b>Recommended:</b> userName, isCorrect, ...
    - <b>Uncommon:</b> user_name, iscorrect, ...
