# Reacting to Events

Your task is to work on a <i>"User Login"</i> component that has already been prepared by a colleague.

The goal is to update the data stored in the already existing `user` object with some dummy data once the <i>"Login"</i> button in the `App` component is pressed.

The `email` and `password` properties in the `user` object should be set to any non-empty string values of your choice. The `loggedIn` field should be set to `true`.

<b>Important:</b> You <b>don't</b> have to fetch the values entered into the `<input>` fields - you can simply ignore those fields for now. You'll learn how to listen to keystrokes and get user input later in the course.

# Learning objective

Handle user events in a React app and enhance a "User Login" form by changing data stored in an object once the user clicks the "Login" button.
