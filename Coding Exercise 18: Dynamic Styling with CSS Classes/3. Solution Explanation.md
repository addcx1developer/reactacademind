# Solution Explanation

In the solution, a new piece of state is managed in the `App` component: the `choice` state. Though, the name of the state of course is up to you.

The `choice` state is either set to `undefined` (its initial value), `"yes"` (if the <i>"Yes"</i> button was clicked) or `"no"` (if the <i>"No"</i> button was clicked).

The state is changed in event handler functions (anonymous functions in this solution) that are set as values for the `onClick` props on the `<button>` elements.

```
function App() {
    const [choice, setChoice] = useState(null);

    return (
        <div id="app">
            <h1>CSS is great!</h1>
            <menu>
                <li>
                    <button onClick={() => setChoice('yes')}>Yes</button>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <button onClick={() => setChoice('no')}>No</button>
                </li>
            </menu>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Of course, you could alternatively also manage some boolean state (e.g., named `cssIsGreat`) that's `undefined` or `null` initially and then set to `true` or `false` depending on which button was clicked. As so often in development, there is more than one valid approach.

Either way, the state is then used to derive the CSS class that should be added.

In the provided solution, this is done with help of a `cssClass` variable which is set to `undefined` initially and then changed to `"highlight-green"` (for `choice === 'yes'`) or `"highlight-red"` (for `choice === 'no'`). This `cssClass` variable is then set as a value for `className` on the `h1` element.

```
function App() {
    const [choice, setChoice] = useState(null);

    let cssClass;

    if (choice === 'yes') {
        cssClass = 'highlight-green';
    } else if (choice === 'no') {
        cssClass = 'highlight-red';
    }

    return (
        <div id="app">
            <h1 className={cssClass}>CSS is great!</h1>
            <menu>
                <li>
                    <button onClick={() => setChoice('yes')}>Yes</button>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <button onClick={() => setChoice('no')}>No</button>
                </li>
            </menu>
        </div>
    );
}
```
