# Hints

-   For this task, you should not use props, lifted-up-state or anything like that - instead, use React's Context API
-   To use the Context API, you'll need to do three main things:
    -   Create a context
    -   Provide the context value (which includes the `theme` property and the `toggleTheme()` method)
    -   Consume the context
-   Set the provided context `theme` value dynamically - i.e., via state
-   Use a separate "Provider" component that wraps any children passed to it
-   Wrap the `Page` component with the Provider component (inside the `App`) component
