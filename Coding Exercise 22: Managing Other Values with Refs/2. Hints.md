# Hints

-   You can start a timer via the built-in `setTimeout` function (`setTimeout(callbackFn, timeInMilliseconds)`)
-   You can stop timers via the built-in `clearTimeout` function
-   In order to stop timers from a different place than where they were started, you must store & use the timer "reference" returned by `setTimeout`
-   Maybe you should use a ref for storing that timer reference?
