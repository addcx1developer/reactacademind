# Update Object-State Immutably

1. <b>Objects & arrays</b> (which technically are objects) are <b>reference values</b> in JavaScript
2. You should therefore <b>not mutate</b> them directly - instead create a <b>(deep) copy</b> first!

```
const [updatedUser = user;]
[user.name] = "Heather";
```

-   `NOT creating a copy` (because user is an object = a reference value)
-   Editing the user object in memory

```
const updatedUser = [{ ...user };]
[updatedUser.name] = "Heather";
```

-   Creating a copy via JavaScript's "Spread" operator
-   Editing the copy, not the original
