# React Essentials - Practice Project

Apply Your Knowledge & Practice What You Learned

-   Build an "Investment Calculator" Web App
-   Build, Configure & Combine `Components`
-   Manage Application `State`
-   Output `List` & `Conditional` Content

## Time To Practice! (Your Task)

Build an "Investment Calculator" web app

-   Use the `starting project` attached to this lecture
-   Add `components` for displaying a `header`, fetching `user input` & outputting the `results table`
-   Fetch & store user input (i.e., the entered investment parameters)
-   `Derive investment results` with help of the provided utility function (in the starting project)
-   `Display` investment results in a HTML `table` (use `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>` `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`)
-   `Conditionally` display an info message if an `invalid duration` (< 1) was entered

## You Can't Fail!

-   There's `More Than One Way` Of Building This!
-   My solution (shown in the next lectures) is `not the only correct solution!`
-   And even if you can't build the entire app - simply `try to get as close as possible!`
