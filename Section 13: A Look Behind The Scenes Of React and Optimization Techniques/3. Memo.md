# memo()

Compares prop values

```
Old Prop Value (initialCount) <=> Counter Component <=> New Prop Value (initialCount)
```

`Equal` => Counter component function `will not` execute

| Old Prop Value | New Prop Value |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 0              | 0              |

`Not equal` => Counter component function `will` execute

| Old Prop Value | New Prop Value |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 0              | 10             |

## `Don't overuse` memo()!

Use it `as high up in the component tree as possible`

-   blocking a component execution there will also block all child component executions

Checking props with memo() `costs performance`!

-   don't wrap it around all your components - it will just add a lot of unnecessary checks

`Don't` use it on components where `props will change frequently`

-   memo() would just perform a meaningless check in such cases (which costs performance)
