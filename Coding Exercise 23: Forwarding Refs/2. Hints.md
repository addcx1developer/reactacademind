# Hints

-   To set the `<label>` text, you should get hold of the `label` prop (inside the `Input` component) and use it appropriately
-   You can destructure incoming props and also collect remaining props into a combined props object (via JavaScript's special `...props` syntax)
-   You can <i>"spread"</i> object key-value pairs as prop key-value pairs onto a component via the special `{...props}` syntax
-   Keep in mind that you <b>can't</b> accept and use the special `ref` prop like other props
-   Instead you have to use a special function offered by React to <i>"wrap"</i> a component that should be able to accept that special `ref` prop
-   In this Udemy exercise workspace, that special function, just like Hooks, can't be imported directly - instead, you have to `import React from 'react'` and call functions (like Hooks) on that `React` object (e.g., `React.useState()`)
