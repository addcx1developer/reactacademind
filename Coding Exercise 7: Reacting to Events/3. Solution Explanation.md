# Solution Explanation

In this solution <i>(see below)</i>, a new `handleLogin` function is added inside the `App` component. This function is then used as a value for the `onClick` prop which was added to the `<button>` element.

The built-in elements (like `<button>`) support those special `onXYZ` props to <i>"connect"</i> event handling functions to user events & elements.

<b>Important:</b> `handleLogin` is not executed (i.e., it's `onClick={handleLogin}`, not `onClick={handleLogin()}`) since it should be React which executes those functions (when a <i>"click"</i> event occurs).

```
export const user = {
    email: '',
    password: '',
    loggedIn: false,
};

// Please note: The login does not actually work!
// This exercise is just about practicing event handling
// You'll learn how to add user authentication to React apps later in the course!
function App() {
    function handleLogin() {
        user.email = 'test@example.com';
        user.password = 'test';
        user.loggedIn = true;
    }

    return (
        <div id="app">
            <h1>User Login</h1>
            <p>
                <label>Email</label>
                {/* You don't need to do anything with those inputs! You'll learn how to handle user input later */}
                <input type="email" />
            </p>

            <p>
                <label>Password</label>
                {/* You don't need to do anything with those inputs! You'll learn how to handle user input later */}
                <input type="password" />
            </p>

            <p id="actions">
                <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
