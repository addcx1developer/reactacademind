# JSX & React Components [Core Concept]

## Describe The Target UI With JSX

`JSX` (JavaScript Syntax eXtension)

```
<div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>JSX code is awesome!</p>
</div>
```

Used to describe & create HTML elements in JavaScript in a `declarative` way

But `Browsers do not support JSX`!

React projects come with a `build process` that `transforms` JSX code (behind the scenes) to code that `does work` in browsers

# Component Functions Must Follow Two Rules

1. Name Starts With Uppercase Character
    - The function name `must start` with an `uppercase` character
    - `Multi-word` names should be written in `PascalCase` (e.g., "MyHeader")
    - It's `recommended` to pick a name that `describes` the UI building block (e.g., "Header" or "MyHeader")
2. Returns "Renderable" Content
    - The function must `return` a value that can be `rendered` ("displayed on screen") by React
    - In `most` cases: Return `JSX`
    - Also allowed: string, number, boolean, null, array of allowed values
