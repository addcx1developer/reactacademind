# Configuring Event Handlers

Your task is to <b>edit</b> the `<button>` in the `App` component such that the already defined `handleCreateUser` function is called with a value for `name`.

So you must not hard-code the value that should be assigned to `user.name` in the `handleCreateUser` function but instead pass it as a value for the `name` parameter when a click event on the `<button>` occurs.

You <b>don't</b> have to care about any value that might be entered into the `<input>` field - it's just there for decoration purposes.

# Learning objective

Build and use an event handler that needs an input value that's not automatically provided by React.
