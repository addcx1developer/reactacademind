| Advantages                                                         | Disadvantages                                              |

| Quick & easy to add                                                | You need to know CSS                                       |
| You continue "thinking in React" (-> configurable style functions) | No clear separation of React & CSS code                    |
| Styles are scoped to components -> No CSS rule clashes             | You end up with many relatively small "wrapper" components |
