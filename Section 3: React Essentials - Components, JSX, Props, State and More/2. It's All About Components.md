# It's All About Components! [Core Concept]

## Components

-   Components are UI building blocks
-   React apps are built by `Combining Components`
-   Components can potentially be reused
-   Different components, different responsibilities

## Components Are The Foundation

-   JSX
-   Props
-   State

## Build User Interfaces With Components

-   Any website or app can be broken down into smaller building blocks: `Components`
-   It can therefore also be built by creatng & combining such components

## Creating Components

-   React Component
    -   HTML
    -   CSS
    -   JavaScript

## Why Components?

1. Reusable Building Blocks
    - Create `small building blocks` & `compose` the UI from them
    - If needed: `Reuse` a building block in different parts of the UI (e.g., a reusable button)
2. Related Code Lives Together
    - Related HTML & JS (and possibly CSS) code is `stored together`
    - Since JS influences the output, storing JS + HTML together makes sense
3. Separation of Concerns
    - `Different` components handle different data & logic
    - Vastly `simplifies` the process of working on complex apps
