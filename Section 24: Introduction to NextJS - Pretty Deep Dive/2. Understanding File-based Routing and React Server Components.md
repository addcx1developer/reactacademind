# Filesystem-based Routing

NextJS uses files & folders to define routes

Only files & folders inside the "app" folder are considered!

-   /app
    -   /about -> my-page.com/about
    -   /blog -> my-page.com/blog
        -   /post-1 -> my-page.com/blog/post-1

# NextJS Works With React Server Components

Components which require a special "environment"

NextJS provides such an environment

## React Server Components

Rendered `only on the server Never` on the client
