# Using useReducer()

Your task is to build a basic counter app that uses React's `useReducer()` Hook for state management - <b>not</b> the useState() Hook!

To achieve this goal, you should enhance the already existing `counterReducer` function that can be found right next to the `App` component (don't remove the `export` keyword!).

In addition, inside the `App` component, the `useReducer` Hook should be used with that reducer function to manage the counter state.

The three `<button>` elements should be <i>"connected"</i> to the reducer-managed state (i.e., they should trigger state changes), the `<p id="counter">` element should output the count value.

<b>Important:</b> The state managed with help of the reducer must be an object of the following shape:

```
{
    count: 0; // of course, 0 is not static but changes as the different <button>s are clicked
}
```

When dispatching actions, you should make sure that every action is an object that has a `type` property (it must be named `type` - other names will make the automatic checks fail!) that contains either `'INCREMENT'`, `'DECREMENT'` or `'RESET'` as a value!

<b>Important:</b> In this Udemy exercise workspace, any React Hooks must be accessed directly on the imported `React` object (`import React from 'react'`) - for example: `React.useState()`.
