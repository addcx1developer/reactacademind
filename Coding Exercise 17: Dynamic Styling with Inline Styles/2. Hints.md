# Hints

-   Apply the styles via inline styles - not via CSS classes
-   Use `color: "green"` and `color: "red"` - no variations
-   Keep in mind that React expects an object as a value for the `style` prop
-   In order to set colors dynamically, you'll need to manage some value that changes over time (and which, when changed, updates the UI)
