# Solution Explanation

As a first step, you should make sure that the `Todo` component is able to receive and output a `text` prop:

```
import React from 'react';

export default function Todo(props) {
    return <li>{props.text}</li>;
}
```

With that out of the way, you can re-use this `Todo` component for different todo items.

Therefore, as a next step, you should dynamically map the `DUMMY_TODOS` array to an array full of `<Todo />` JSX elements (which then can be output as part of the `App` component's JSX code). This is achieved via the built-in `map()` method (called on `DUMMY_TODOS`):

```
import React from 'react';

import Todo from './Todo';
import './styles.css';

export const DUMMY_TODOS = [
    'Learn React',
    'Practice React',
    'Profit!'
];

// don't change the Component name "App"
export default function App() {
    return (
        <ul>
            {DUMMY_TODOS.map(todo => <Todo text={todo} />)}
        </ul>
    );
}
```

In this code, you see that a (anonymous) function is passed to the `map()` method. This function is automatically executed by JavaScript - once for every item in `DUMMY_TODOS`. It automatically receives the item, for which it's currently executed, as an argument and must return the new value to which the item is transformed.

In this case, the old item values (which are plain strings like `"Learn React"`) are transformed to `<Todo />` JSX elements. The text property is set on `<Todo />` to pass the todo item text to the `Todo` component.
